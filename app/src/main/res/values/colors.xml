    <!--Color-->

    <!--Material uses an organized approach to applying color by providing a set of attributes -->
    <!--which define the color of generalized UI elements such as backgrounds, surfaces, type -->
    <!--and icons. Using these attributes throughout your app makes it easy to change a single -->
    <!--color, or the entire theme, and have those changes cascade through the interface.-->

    <!--Color is customized by overriding Material Components color attributes with custom -->
    <!--color values. In this project, your theme’s color attributes are already overridden -->
    <!--with default values defined in this file, color.xml.  Change any of the values in -->
    <!--this file to see changes applied across all elements of your app.-->
